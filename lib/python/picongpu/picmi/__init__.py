"""
PICMI for PIConGPU

The top level exposes exactly the objects a user passes to
:class:`~picongpu.picmi.simulation.Simulation` or
:class:`~picongpu.picmi.species.Species` (or picmistandard names), plus the
deliberately bound concern submodules. Everything else lives at its concern
level:

* diagnostics and their inputs (``RangeSpec``, ``TimeStepSpec``, ...) live in
  :mod:`picongpu.picmi.diagnostics`,
* functor-authoring helpers (``ParticleFunctor``, ``ParticleFilter``,
  ``FilteredSpecies``, ...) live in :mod:`picongpu.picmi.particle_functor`,
* unions (``AnyInteraction``, ``AnyAppliedField``, ...) live with their concern
  submodule and are never promoted to the top level,
* physical constants live only in :mod:`picongpu.picmi.constants`.

Backend (``pypicongpu``) objects are not re-exported here.
